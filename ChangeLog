	* acinclude.m4: Removed unneeded macros AC_NTA_NET_SIZE_T,
	  PGAC_TYPE_64BIT_INT, and PGAC_FUNC_SNPRINTF_LONG_LONG_INT_FORMAT
	  as these are not required by ipgen. Fixed typo in
	  'if test "X$CC" != "X"' check.

	* configure.ac: Removed obsolete macros AC_HEADER_STDC and
	  AC_C_CONST because all modern systems should have an ANSI C
	  compiler. Removed function check for inet_aton as all modern
	  systems should have this function (Solaris 8 doesn't have it
	  but this has been obsolete for many years). Incremented version
	  number to 1.1 to reflect recent changes.

	* ipgen.h: Made ANSI C standard header includes unconditional.

	* inet_aton.c: Removed

	* check-error, check-output, check-run1: Changed "$srcdir/ipgen" to
	  "./ipgen" in test scripts so "make distcheck" succeeds.

	* .github/workflows/c-cpp.yml: Enable "make distcheck" step.

        * README.md, .github/workflows/*: Migrated from travis-ci to github
          actions for CI/CD build check and code coverage report.

        * .travis.yml: removed as no longer needed.

2013-12-01 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ipgen.c: Removed occurances of set but unused variables as
	  reported by -Wunused-but-set-variable in gcc 4.6.

	* check-output: Added tests to check single host, network and
	  broadcast, and reading input from a file.

	* check-error: New test to check ipgen error behaviour.

2013-12-01 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac, .gitignore: Added configure option --enable-gcov to
	  enable gcov code coverage.

2013-09-05 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Change the bug-report string in AC_INIT from the
	  ipgen email address to the github URL.

	* ipgen.c, check-run1:  updated to take account of changes to
	  bug-report string.

2013-08-17 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Removed $Id$ keywords from all files, and associated rcsid variables
	  from C source. These are not really needed and they don't work with
	  git.

	* .gitignore: new file containing file patterns that should not be
	  committed to the repository.

	* .travis.yml: new file to enable automatic building on Travis CI
